# ai_ml_Projects
Curated collection of applied AI &amp; ML projects developed by B.Tech final-year student teams under the technical supervision of Abhay Kumar Dubey. I designed the problem scope, guided model development, reviewed, debugged, and standardized the projects to demonstrate real-world ML workflows across engineering and healthcare domains.
